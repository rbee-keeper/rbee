# TEAM-XXX: Marketplace environment variables
# Copy this file to .env.local for local development

# ============================================
# DEVELOPMENT (Use localhost URLs)
# ============================================
# For local development, use these localhost URLs:

# Marketplace API (global worker catalog)
MARKETPLACE_API_URL=http://localhost:8787

# Cross-app URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:7823

# Disable Next.js devtools to prevent errors
NEXT_DISABLE_DEVTOOLS=1

# ============================================
# PRODUCTION (Set in Cloudflare Pages dashboard)
# ============================================
# These are automatically set by Cloudflare Pages for production builds.
# DO NOT set these in .env.local - they will override localhost URLs!

# MARKETPLACE_API_URL=https://gwc.rbee.dev
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://marketplace.rbee.dev
