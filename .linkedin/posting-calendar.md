- Major holidays
- Personal time off

### When to Double Down
- Post goes viral → Follow-up series
- High GitHub star spike → Thank community

---

## Success Tracking

### Focus On
- GitHub stars (main goal: 100 in 3 months)
- Recognition in AI/ML community
- Quality engagement (not just likes)

### Don't Track
- No spreadsheets

- No detailed analytics

### Simple Review
- What posts got most engagement?
- What topics resonated?
- What drove GitHub stars?

**Remember:** GitHub stars + community recognition = success. High engagement without stars = not success. 🐝
