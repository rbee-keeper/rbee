## 📊 How Far Along Are We?

**Check CHECKLIST_00_OVERVIEW.md** - It has the complete progress tracking system.

Each checklist shows:
- ✅ Which tasks are complete
- 🎯 What you're working on now
- ⚠️ Any blockers
- 📈 Overall progress percentage

**That's it. One file to check progress. One file to see what's next.**

## 📚 Architecture Docs (Reference Only)

**You don't need to read these unless a checklist tells you to.**

The checklists reference these documents when needed:
- `COMPLETE_ONBOARDING_FLOW.md` - End-to-end user flow
- `MARKETPLACE_SHARED_COMPONENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Component design
- `URL_PROTOCOL_REGISTRATION.md` - Platform-specific `rbee://` setup
- `BROWSER_TAB_SYSTEM.md` - Tab system architecture
- `WORKER_SPAWNING_3_STEPS.md` - Spawning wizard UX
- `WOW_FACTOR_LAUNCH_MVP.md` - Demo & launch plan

**Don't read them all upfront. Read them when the checklist says to.**

## 🚀 Quick Facts

**What are we building?**
- SEO-optimized marketplace (marketplace.rbee.dev) with 1000+ model pages
- Tauri desktop app (Keeper) with `rbee://` protocol handler
- One-click flow: Google search → Running model in 60 seconds

**Timeline:** 5 weeks
