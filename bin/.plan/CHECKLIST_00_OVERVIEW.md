## 📅 Timeline & Dependencies

### Week 1: Foundations (Can Start Immediately)
```
Day 1-7: Checklist 01 (Marketplace Components in rbee-ui)
Day 1-3: Checklist 02 (Rust + WASM SDK) - Parallel
```

**TEAM-400 Changes:**
- Checklist 01 is FASTER (no package setup, use existing rbee-ui)
- Checklist 02 is DIFFERENT (Rust instead of TypeScript)

### Week 2-3: Applications (Parallel)
```
Day 8-14: Checklist 03 (Update existing marketplace app)
Day 8-14: Checklist 04 (Add protocol to existing Keeper) - Parallel
```

**TEAM-400 Changes:**
- Both are FASTER (use existing apps)
- No complex setup needed

### Week 4: Keeper UI
```
Day 15-21: Checklist 05 (Add marketplace page to existing Keeper UI)
```

**TEAM-400 Changes:**
- Much FASTER (UI already exists with routing)

### Week 5: Launch
```
Day 22-24: Checklist 06 (Demo prep & launch)
Day 25-28: Post-launch monitoring, bug fixes, iteration
```

---

## 🎯 Critical Path

```
Checklist 01 (Components in rbee-ui) ──┐
                                       ├──> Checklist 03 (Update marketplace app) ──┐
Checklist 02 (Rust + WASM SDK) ────────┤                                            │
                                       └──> Checklist 04 (Add protocol to Keeper) ──┴──> Checklist 05 (Add marketplace to Keeper UI) ──> Checklist 06 (Launch)
```

**Key Points:**
- Week 1: Sequential (01 → 02, but 02 can start on Day 1)
- Week 2-3: Parallel (03 || 04)
- Week 4-5: Sequential (05 → 06)

**TEAM-400 Improvements:**
- All steps are FASTER than originally planned
- Less setup, more implementation
- Use existing infrastructure

---

## 🔥 RULE ZERO Applied

**TEAM-400:** All checklists updated with RULE ZERO - breaking changes to fix architecture.

### Example 1: Components
**OLD:** Create separate `@rbee/marketplace-components` package  
**NEW:** Use `rbee-ui/src/marketplace/` directory

**Impact:** No duplicate packages, single source of truth.

### Example 2: SDK
**OLD:** TypeScript SDK with manual types  
**NEW:** Rust + WASM + tsify with auto-generated types

**Impact:** Compiler-verified types, no manual sync, works everywhere.

### Example 3: Next.js App
**OLD:** Create new Next.js app from scratch  
**NEW:** Use existing `frontend/apps/marketplace/`

**Impact:** Just add content, no setup.

### Example 4: Keeper
**OLD:** Set up Tauri from scratch  
**NEW:** Use existing Keeper Tauri app

**Impact:** Just add protocol, no setup.

## 📝 Architecture Summary

**TEAM-400:** What actually exists vs. what checklists originally assumed.

### What EXISTS (Don't Create!)
- ✅ `frontend/apps/marketplace/` - Next.js 15 + Cloudflare
- ✅ `bin/00_rbee_keeper/` - Tauri v2 app
- ✅ `bin/00_rbee_keeper/ui/` - React UI with routing + Zustand
- ✅ `frontend/packages/rbee-ui/` - Atomic design UI library
- ✅ `frontend/packages/rbee-ui/src/marketplace/` - Empty, ready for use

### What to CREATE
- 🆕 `rbee-ui/src/marketplace/organisms/` - ModelCard, WorkerCard, etc.
- 🆕 `rbee-ui/src/marketplace/templates/` - ModelListTemplate, etc.
- 🆕 `rbee-ui/src/marketplace/pages/` - ModelsPage, etc.
- 🆕 `bin/99_shared_crates/marketplace-sdk/` - Rust + WASM SDK
- 🆕 `bin/00_rbee_keeper/src/handlers/protocol.rs` - Protocol handler
- 🆕 `bin/00_rbee_keeper/ui/src/pages/MarketplacePage.tsx` - Marketplace page

### What NOT to Create (Common Mistakes)
- ❌ `frontend/packages/marketplace-components/` - Use rbee-ui instead!
- ❌ `frontend/packages/marketplace-sdk/` - Use Rust crate instead!
- ❌ New Next.js app - Use existing marketplace app!
- ❌ New Tauri project - Use existing Keeper!
- ❌ New UI app - Use existing Keeper UI!

## 🎯 Key Principles

1. **USE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE** - Don't recreate what exists
2. **RULE ZERO** - Breaking changes > backwards compatibility
3. **ONE CHECKBOX AT A TIME** - Complete each before moving
4. **TEST EVERYTHING** - Don't skip testing
5. **FOLLOW THE ORDER** - Checklists are sequenced correctly

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Daily Standup Format

**Each team reports:**
1. ✅ Completed yesterday
2. 🎯 Working on today
3. ⚠️ Blockers (if any)

**Example:**
```
Team A (Day 3/7 - Checklist 01):
✅ ModelCard component complete in rbee-ui/src/marketplace/organisms/
✅ WorkerCard component complete
🎯 Implementing MarketplaceGrid
⚠️ None
```
