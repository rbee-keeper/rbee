**Total: 10 files (33% reduction from 15+ files)**

## What Was Fixed

### Accuracy ✅
- ✅ Multi-license (GPL/MIT/Proprietary) everywhere
- ✅ Bundle strategy (5 products: 2 individual, 3 bundles)
- ✅ "Premium Worker requires Queen" explained clearly
- ✅ GDPR clarified (basic free MIT, full €249 premium)
- ✅ Timeline corrected (M3 in Q1 2026, not Q3)
- ✅ Removed "68% (42/62 BDD scenarios)" outdated metric
- ✅ Removed all "Managed Platform" mentions
- ✅ All pricing consistent (€129, €179, €249, €279, €349, €499)

### Bee Theme Integration 🐝
- ✅ Queen = THE BRAIN (orchestrator, makes routing decisions)
- ✅ Hives = HOUSING (worker nodes across machines)
- ✅ Workers = EXECUTORS (do inference on GPUs)
- ✅ Beekeeper = MANAGER (manages the colony)
- ✅ Colony = Unified cluster
- ✅ Architecture diagrams with bee terminology
- ✅ Bee-themed taglines throughout

### Messaging ✅
- ✅ "6 unique advantages" (not just features)
- ✅ "ONLY solution" competitive positioning
- ✅ Consumer: "One hive for everything" 🐝
- ✅ Business: "Turn your farm into a thriving hive" 🐝
- ✅ Technical: "The Queen orchestrates, workers execute" 🐝

### Consistency ✅
- ✅ Same messaging across all documents
- ✅ Same pricing across all documents
- ✅ Same timeline across all documents
- ✅ No contradictions anywhere
- ✅ All cross-references work

## Bee Theme Examples

### Architecture
```
🐝 The rbee Colony Architecture

Beekeeper (rbee-keeper) ← Manages the colony
    ↓
Queen (queen-rbee) ← THE BRAIN - Makes ALL routing decisions
    ↓
Hives (rbee-hive) ← HOUSING - Worker nodes across machines
    ↓
Workers (llm-worker-rbee) ← EXECUTORS - Do inference on GPUs
```

### Taglines
- **Consumer:** "One hive for everything" 🐝
- **Business:** "Turn your farm into a thriving hive" 🐝
- **Technical:** "The Queen orchestrates, workers execute" 🐝
