# Installation

This guide covers installing rbee on your system. rbee consists of several components that work together to create your AI colony.

## System requirements

### Minimum requirements

- **Operating system:** Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+), macOS 13+, or Windows 11 with WSL2
- **RAM:** 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
- **Storage:** 20GB for base system, plus space for models (typically 4-50GB per model)
- **Network:** SSH access between machines (for multi-machine setups)

### GPU requirements

rbee supports heterogeneous GPU configurations:

- **NVIDIA GPUs:** CUDA 11.8+ (RTX 20/30/40 series, A-series, H-series)
- **AMD GPUs:** ROCm 5.7+ (experimental support)
- **Apple Silicon:** M1/M2/M3 series with Metal acceleration
- **CPU-only:** Supported but significantly slower

## Installation methods

### Quick install (recommended)

The fastest way to get started on a single machine:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.rbee.dev | sh
```

This installs:
- `rbee-keeper` - The GUI application
- `queen-rbee` - The orchestrator
- `rbee-hive` - The worker host daemon

### Manual installation

For more control or air-gapped environments:

1. **Download the latest release:**

   Visit [github.com/veighnsche/llama-orch/releases](https://github.com/veighnsche/llama-orch/releases) and download the appropriate binaries for your platform.

2. **Extract and install:**

   ```bash
   tar -xzf rbee-*.tar.gz
   sudo mv rbee-* /usr/local/bin/
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**

   ```bash
   rbee-keeper --version
   queen-rbee --version
   rbee-hive --version
   ```

### Building from source

For developers or custom builds:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/veighnsche/llama-orch.git
cd llama-orch

# Build all binaries (requires Rust 1.75+)
cargo build --release

# Binaries will be in target/release/
```

## Initial configuration

After installation, create the base configuration directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.rbee
```

rbee will auto-generate configuration files on first run. For advanced configuration options, see the [Configuration guide](/docs/guides/configuration).

## Verify installation

Check that all components are installed correctly:

```bash
# Check keeper (GUI)
rbee-keeper --version

# Check queen (orchestrator)
queen-rbee --version

# Check hive (worker host)
rbee-hive --version
```

## Next steps

- **[Single machine setup](/docs/getting-started/single-machine)** - Run rbee on one computer
- **[Homelab setup](/docs/getting-started/homelab)** - Connect multiple machines
- **[GPU provider setup](/docs/getting-started/gpu-providers)** - Build an API platform

## Troubleshooting

### Permission errors

If you encounter permission errors, ensure the binaries are executable:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rbee-*
```

### GPU not detected

Verify your GPU drivers are installed:

```bash
# NVIDIA
nvidia-smi

# AMD
rocm-smi

# Apple Silicon (should show GPU info)
system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType
```

### Network connectivity issues

For multi-machine setups, ensure SSH is configured and accessible:

```bash
ssh user@remote-machine "echo 'SSH works'"
```
