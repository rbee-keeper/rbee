- Technical credibility posts
- Attract developers who influence company decisions

## 👥 Target Audiences

### Primary: B2B (80%)
- **Companies running AI locally:** Security, privacy, compliance
- **GPU infrastructure operators:** Have hardware, need orchestration
- **European businesses:** GDPR compliance requirements
- **Startups without DevOps teams:** Need simple deployment
- **Businesses with heterogeneous hardware:** NVIDIA + Apple + AMD

**Goal:** Recognition in AI/ML community, premium inquiries

### Secondary: Technical Credibility (20%)
- **Homelabbers:** Influence enterprise decisions
- **Technical leaders:** Evaluate tools for companies
- **Open source advocates:** GitHub stars, community

**Goal:** 100 GitHub stars in 3 months, technical credibility

## 📊 Content Mix

### 6 Posts Per Week
- **3 English posts** (global/international angle)
- **3 Dutch posts** (European/GDPR angle, unique content)
- **Mon-Wed-Fri schedule**

### Content Types
- **Competitive posts:** vs Ollama, vLLM, Ray+KServe, Together.ai
- **Feature posts:** SSH deployment, heterogeneous hardware, marketplace
- **ROI posts:** Build vs buy, cost savings, GDPR compliance
- **Technical posts:** Multi-machine orchestration, architecture
- **Brand posts:** Worker marketplace, "finally a product that solves this"

## 🗣️ Brand Voice

### Tone Examples
✅ **RIGHT:** "Stop building custom AI platforms. rbee is the platform."
✅ **RIGHT:** "Ollama can't orchestrate multiple machines. rbee can."
✅ **RIGHT:** "Kubernetes for AI? There's a simpler way."
❌ **WRONG:** "Ollama is great for one machine, rbee is for many machines."

### Writing Style
- **Short punchy sentences** - No long paragraphs
- **Rhetorical questions** - "Why pay for cloud APIs when you own GPUs?"
- **Confident engineer tone** - Explaining something obvious
- **Decisive-dismissive (80%)** - "X can't do this. rbee can."
- **Analytical (20%)** - "X focuses on Y; rbee scales beyond."

### The Bee Metaphor 🐝
- **One 🐝 emoji per post** (first line)
- **Bee terms only in brand posts** (not technical posts)
- **Parentheses format:** "Orchestrator (Queen), Nodes (Hives), Workers"
- **Allowed:** "Build your hive", "Unite your colony"
- **Too cheesy:** "Join the hive", "The colony is buzzing"
