# Licensing

rbee uses a mixed licensing model designed to keep the core system free and open source while offering premium modules for production use cases.

## Overview

rbee's licensing strategy balances open source principles with sustainable business model:

- **Open core** - Base system is free forever under permissive licenses
- **Premium modules** - Production-grade features sold as one-time lifetime licenses
- **No subscriptions** - Pay once, use forever
- **No feature limits** - Free version is fully functional, not crippled

## Open source components

The following components are open source and free to use:

### GPL-3.0-or-later

These components are licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0 or later:

- **queen-rbee** - The orchestrator
- **rbee-hive** - The worker host daemon
- **rbee-keeper** - The GUI application (Tauri frontend)

**What this means:**
- Free to use for any purpose
- Free to modify and distribute
- If you distribute modified versions, you must share source code under GPL-3.0
- Commercial use is allowed

**Why GPL-3.0:**
These are the "system" components that benefit from strong copyleft protection, ensuring improvements remain open source.

### MIT License

These components are licensed under MIT License:

- **Shared libraries** - Common Rust crates used across components
- **Worker implementations** - LLM workers (current), multi-modal workers planned (M3)
- **Configuration schemas** - TOML/JSON configuration formats

**What this means:**
- Free to use for any purpose
- Free to modify and distribute
- No requirement to share modifications
- Can be integrated into proprietary software
- Commercial use is allowed

**Why MIT:**
These are library components that benefit from maximum permissiveness, encouraging adoption and integration.

## Premium modules

**Note:** Premium modules are planned for M2 launch (target Q2 2026). Details shown are the planned structure.

Premium modules are proprietary software sold as one-time lifetime licenses. They add production-grade features for businesses running rbee as a product.

## Licensing FAQ

### Can I use rbee commercially?

**Yes.** Both GPL-3.0 and MIT licenses allow commercial use. You can:
- Use rbee to run your business
- Offer AI services using rbee
- Charge customers for API access
- Deploy rbee in production

### Do I need premium modules?

**For personal use:** No. The open source version is fully functional.

**For business use:** It depends:
- **Small scale** (< 10 customers, < 5 GPUs): Open source is fine
- **Medium scale** (10-100 customers, 5-20 GPUs): Premium Queen recommended
- **Large scale** (100+ customers, 20+ GPUs): Premium Bundle recommended
- **GDPR compliance needed:** GDPR Auditing Module required

### What happens if I modify GPL-3.0 components?

If you modify GPL-3.0 components (queen, hive, keeper) and distribute them:
- You must share your modifications under GPL-3.0
- You must provide source code to recipients
- You can charge for your distribution

If you only use rbee internally (not distributing):
- No requirement to share modifications
- You can keep changes private

### Can I integrate rbee into my proprietary software?

**Yes, with conditions:**

- **MIT components** (workers, libraries): Yes, freely
- **GPL-3.0 components** (queen, hive, keeper): Only if your software is also GPL-3.0, or if you use rbee as a separate service (not linked into your code)

**Recommended approach:** Use rbee as a separate service (microservice architecture). Your proprietary app talks to rbee via HTTP API. This avoids GPL-3.0 requirements.

### Are premium modules subscriptions?

**No.** Premium modules are one-time lifetime licenses:
- Pay once, use forever
- No recurring fees
- Free updates for the major version you purchased
- Includes bug fixes and security patches

### What's included in "lifetime"?

- **Lifetime of the product** - As long as rbee exists
- **All minor updates** - e.g., v1.0 → v1.1 → v1.9
- **Major version upgrades** - Discounted upgrade path to v2.0, v3.0, etc.

### Can I transfer my premium license?

**Yes.** Premium licenses can be transferred:
- Between your own servers (unlimited)
- To another person/company (one-time transfer fee: €50)

### Do I need a license per server?

**No.** Premium licenses are per-colony, not per-server:
- One Premium Queen license covers one queen instance
- One Premium Worker license covers unlimited workers in that colony
- One GDPR Auditing license covers one queen instance

**Example:**
- 1 queen + 10 hives + 50 workers = 1 Premium Bundle license

### What if I can't afford premium modules?

**Options:**
1. **Use open source version** - Fully functional, no limits
2. **Academic/research discount** - 50% off for educational institutions
3. **Open source contributor discount** - 30% off if you contribute to rbee
4. **Startup program** - Free Premium Bundle for first year (apply via email)
