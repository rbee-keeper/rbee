# Homelab & Power Users

This guide shows how to connect multiple machines into one unified rbee colony. Perfect for homelab enthusiasts who want to use their gaming PC, laptop, Mac, and home server as a single AI system.

## What you'll build

A multi-machine colony where:

- Your workstation runs the keeper (GUI) and queen (orchestrator)
- Your gaming PC contributes its RTX GPU
- Your Mac M3 contributes its unified memory
- Your home server runs CPU workers for background tasks
- All machines appear as one system in the keeper GUI

## Prerequisites

- rbee installed on all machines (see [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation))
- SSH access between machines
- Network connectivity (same LAN or VPN)
- At least one machine with a GPU

## Architecture overview

In a multi-machine setup:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Workstation    │
│  ┌──────────┐   │
│  │  Keeper  │   │ (Your control center)
│  └────┬─────┘   │
│       │         │
│  ┌────▼─────┐   │
│  │  Queen   │   │ (Orchestrator)
│  └────┬─────┘   │
│       │         │
└───────┼─────────┘
        │
        ├─────────────────────────────────┐
        │                                 │
   ┌────▼─────┐                      ┌────▼─────┐
   │Gaming PC │                      │ Mac M3   │
   │  (Hive)  │                      │  (Hive)  │
   │          │                      │          │
   │ ┌──────┐ │                      │ ┌──────┐ │
   │ │Worker│ │ (RTX 3090)           │ │Worker│ │ (Metal)
   │ └──────┘ │                      │ └──────┘ │
   └──────────┘                      └──────────┘
```

## Step 1: Set up SSH access

rbee uses SSH to manage remote hives. Configure passwordless SSH:

```bash
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "rbee@homelab"

# Copy to each remote machine
ssh-copy-id user@gaming-pc
ssh-copy-id user@mac-m3
ssh-copy-id user@home-server

# Test connectivity
ssh user@gaming-pc "echo 'SSH works'"
```

## Step 2: Start the queen (workstation)

On your main workstation, start the queen:

```bash
# Start queen on all network interfaces
rbee queen start
```

Note the IP address of your workstation (e.g., `192.168.1.100`). Remote hives will connect to this address.

## Step 3: Configure hive catalog

Create a hive catalog file at `~/.rbee/hives.conf`:

```toml
# Gaming PC with RTX 3090
[[hive]]
alias = "gaming-pc"
host = "192.168.1.101"
ssh_user = "user"
ssh_port = 22

# Mac M3 with unified memory
[[hive]]
alias = "mac-m3"
host = "192.168.1.102"
ssh_user = "user"
ssh_port = 22

# Home server (CPU only)
[[hive]]
alias = "home-server"
host = "192.168.1.103"
ssh_user = "user"
ssh_port = 22
```

## Step 4: Install rbee on remote hives

Use the queen to install rbee on each remote machine:

```bash
# Install on gaming PC
rbee hive install --host gaming-pc

# Install on Mac
rbee hive install --host mac-m3

# Install on home server
rbee hive install --host home-server
```

This will:
- SSH into each machine
- Download the appropriate rbee-hive binary
- Set up the configuration
- Return without starting the hive

## Step 5: Start remote hives

Start each hive and connect it to your queen:

```bash
# Start gaming PC hive
rbee hive start --host gaming-pc

# Start Mac hive
rbee hive start --host mac-m3

# Start home server hive
rbee hive start --host home-server
```

Each hive will:
- Detect local GPUs/hardware
- Connect to the queen at your workstation
- Send heartbeats with capability information

## Step 6: Verify the colony

Check that all hives are connected:

```bash
# List all hives
rbee hive status

# Get details for a specific hive
rbee hive status --host gaming-pc

# Check status
rbee hive status --host gaming-pc
```

You should see all three hives registered with their GPU information.

## Step 7: Download models to hives

Download models to specific hives based on their capabilities:

```bash
# Large model on gaming PC (24GB VRAM)
rbee model download llama-3.1-70b --hive gaming-pc

# Medium model on Mac (shared memory)
rbee model download llama-3.1-8b --hive mac-m3

# Small model on home server (CPU)
rbee model download llama-3.2-1b --hive home-server
```

## Step 8: Spawn workers across machines

Now spawn workers on different machines:

```bash
# LLM on gaming PC GPU
rbee worker spawn \\
  --hive gaming-pc \\
  --model llama-3.1-70b \\
  --worker cuda \\
  --device 0

# LLM on Mac Metal
rbee worker spawn \\
  --hive mac-m3 \\
  --model llama-3.1-8b \\
  --worker metal \\
  --device 0

# Background worker on home server
rbee worker spawn \\
  --hive home-server \\
  --model llama-3.2-1b \\
  --worker cpu \\
  --device 0
```

## Step 9: Use the unified API

Send requests to the queen. It will route to the appropriate worker:

```bash
# Request automatically routed to best available worker
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.100:7833/v1/chat/completions \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "model": "llama-3.1-70b",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}
    ]
  }'
```

The queen handles routing based on:
- Model availability
- Worker capacity
- GPU utilization

## Step 10: Open the keeper GUI

Start the keeper on your workstation:

```bash
rbee-keeper
```

You'll see:
- All three hives with their hardware specs
- Workers running on each machine
- Real-time GPU utilization across all devices
- Unified chat interface using any worker

## Managing your colony

### Stop a remote hive

```bash
rbee hive stop --host gaming-pc
```

### Restart a hive

```bash
rbee hive stop --host gaming-pc
rbee hive start --host gaming-pc
```

### Remove a hive from the colony

```bash
rbee hive uninstall --host gaming-pc
```

### List all workers across all hives

```bash
rbee worker list
```

## Advanced: Load balancing

For production use, consider Premium Queen which adds:

- Intelligent routing based on model, load, and latency
- Automatic failover when workers crash
- Quota management per hive
- Detailed telemetry and metrics

See [Premium modules](/docs/reference/premium-modules) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### Hive won't connect

Check network connectivity:

```bash
# From workstation, test connection
ping 192.168.1.101
ssh user@gaming-pc "echo 'SSH works'"
```

Verify the queen URL is correct in hive configuration.

### SSH permission denied

Ensure SSH keys are properly configured:

```bash
ssh-copy-id user@gaming-pc
```

Check SSH config on remote machine (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`).

### Worker spawns on wrong hive

Explicitly specify the hive:

```bash
queen-rbee worker spawn --hive gaming-pc --model llama-3.1-70b
```

### Firewall blocking connections

Open port 7833 (or your custom queen port) on the workstation:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo ufw allow 7833/tcp

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=7833/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
